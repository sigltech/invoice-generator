# Invoice Generator

This is a simple invoice generator that allows you to select predetermined services to generate a total price.

This is one of the first projects I created and allowed me to develop my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Use

1. Select the services you want to include in your invoice.
2. Click the service to add it to your invoice.
3. click the remove button to remove the service from your invoice.
4. click the reset button to clear your invoice and start over.
